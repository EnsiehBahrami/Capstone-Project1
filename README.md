# Capstone-Project1
Big Mountain Resort has recently installed an additional chair lift to help increase the distribution of visitors across the mountain. This additional chair increases their
operating costs by $1,540,000 this season. The business wants some guidance on how to select a better value for their ticket price.
We want to train a model to predict Big Mountain's ticket price based on data from _all the other_ resorts or its competitors.
